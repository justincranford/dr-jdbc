Database and application clusters may provide some or all of these features such as:

- Disaster Recovery
- High Availability
- Load Balancing
- Failover
- Replication
- Robustness
- Fault Tolerant 
- etc

This Java library, "dr-jdbc" (a.k.a. "Doctor JDBC"), will be a RDBMS database clustering library. It will be a JDBC Type 4 (Pure Java) driver that can be embedded in a standalone or clustered Java application. Supported replication mechanisms is TBD.

The goal of application coordination for the database cluster will ideally use Dependency Injection, so any Java application clustering framework can be used.
